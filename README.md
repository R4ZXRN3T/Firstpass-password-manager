Hello!

This is my very own password manager:

### Firstpass Password Manager

# Usage:

![Github Guide 01](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23501a7e-6d4a-4136-b7c2-b604f19fc3ed)

In order to use the password manager, just enter the content of the [ ]-brackets for the action you want to do in the appropriate space (image).

Note: after entering the text for the action, press "Enter" to proceed

After a few added entries, the list should look something like this:

# Installation:

in order to install this program, just run the .msi installer from the latest release.

### You NEED to have Java installed to launch the program
Download Java here: https://www.java.com/download

### To all Linux and MacOS users:
A Linux and MacOS installer is planned, but not on priority. Either just use the standalone (portable) Version or create an installer yourself (And then send it to me).

## Standalone Version:

The standalone version does not open on double click.
Instead, you need to launch it via command line.

If Java is installed, just run: ```java -jar Firstpass_standalone.jar``` from the directory the jar is placed in.
If this command is not recognized, make sure that you have properly set your system's enviroment variables.

Alternatively, you can also create a batch file, which executes the command automatically.

Just type in a text document:
```
TITLE Firstpass
java -jar "Firstpass_standalone.jar"
```
Make sure that you also add the .bat or .cmd file extension to the file.

If you encounter any issues with my code, open a new issue on my github page.
