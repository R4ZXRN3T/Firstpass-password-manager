## Project Overview

Firstpass Password Manager is a secure and efficient way to manage your passwords. It allows you to store, organize, and retrieve your passwords with ease.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Java is required to run this application. [Download Java here](https://www.java.com/download).

### Installation Steps
1. Download the .msi installer from the latest release.
2. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.

### To all Linux and MacOS users:
A Linux and MacOS installer is planned, but not on priority. Either use the portable version or create an installer yourself (And then send it to me).

### For self compilation:
1. Compile all `*.java` files from the `src` folder.
2. Compile with the dependencies from `pom.xml`.
3. If you want to compile it as a portable version, add the "assets" folder to the root of the jar. Otherwise, place the "assets" folder next to the jar, as it contains all icons used in the program.

## Usage

After installation, you can launch the app and start managing your passwords. Follow the on-screen instructions to add new passwords and retrieve them when needed.
