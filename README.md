Hello!

This is my very own password manager:

### Firstpass Password Manager

# Installation:

in order to install this program, just run the .msi installer from the latest release.

### You NEED to have Java installed to launch the program
Download Java here: https://www.java.com/download

### To all Linux and MacOS users:
A Linux and MacOS installer is planned, but not on priority. Either just use the portable version or create an installer yourself (And then send it to me).

### For self compilation:
Just compile all *.java files from the src folder. Then compile it with the dependencies from the pom.xml. If you want to compile it as a portable version, you need to add the "assets" folder to the root of the jar. Otherwise you will need to place the "assets" folder next to the jar, as it contains all icons used in the program.

## Portable Version:
